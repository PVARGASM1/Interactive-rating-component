# Interactive-rating-component

This is a solution to the INTERACTIVE RATING COMPONENT project of the Make It Real course.

The challenge
My process: This project was really a challenge for me, because it was very complicated to understand the methods like useState and props. 
Built with: SASS and REACT
What I learned: Use components beetwen anothers components, the logical part of the project like ternary operator & use props beetwen anothers components.
Useful resources: https://sass-lang.com/guide/#modules and https://react.dev/learn

What I learned
Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
